## ToDo for MVP

### General

- Add local storage for Recipes.
- Look into a visual cue for when the recipe list / steps section overflows-y, its hard to tell as is when it's overflowing.
- Keep working on the color palette and where to apply colors to get the ratios right.
- Load with a full example recipe with a history so users can see all the features.
- Once the components are separated well, work on restructuring the recipe page for mobile use.

### Recipe List Section

- Reorganize the title (fix button sizing / coloring).
- Get title section to be sticky.

### Steps Section

- Ability to edit steps.
- Add/edit/view Notes for cooking steps.

### Ingredients Section

- View Ingredients.
- Edit/add/remove ingredients.
- Make the view toggable.

### Settings

- Delete all recipes.
- Delete all info (local storage wipe).
- Display current username / email / password and add ability to edit each.
- Generate new username.

### On the Horizon

- Need to work out how to display the current version vs old version.
- Move the username API offsite and build in the request.
- Integrate the use of https://www.themealdb.com/api.php into the app.
  - Load a random recipe, and convert the object into one that can be interpreted into my layout
